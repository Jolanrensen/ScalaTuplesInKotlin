/**
 * This file provides functions to easily extend Scala Tuples.
 *
 * This means you can easily create a new tuple appended-, or prepended by a new value or tuple.
 *
 * For example (using t() to create a new tuple):
 * ```t(a, b).appendedBy(c) == t(a, b, c)```
 * and
 * ```t(a, b).prependedBy(c) == t(c, a, b)```
 *
 * or in shorthand:
 * ```t(a, b) + c == t(a, b, c)```
 * and
 * ```c + t(a, b) == t(c, a, b)```
 *
 * Using + on two tuples would be quite ambiguous, so you can use [appendedBy], [prependedBy]
 * or use + anyways, which will produce the following:
 * ```t(a, b) + t(c, d) == t(t(a, b), t(c, d))```
 *
 * For merging two tuples together, see [joinedWith].

// t(a, b) + t(c, d) == t(t(a, b), t(c, d)). To merge two tuples use t(a, b)..t(c, d) == t(a, b, c, d)
