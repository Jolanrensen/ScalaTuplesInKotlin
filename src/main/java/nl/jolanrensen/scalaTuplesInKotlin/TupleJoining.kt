/**
 * This file provides functions to easily merge two separate tuples into one.
 *
 * For example (using t() to create a new tuple):
 * ```t(a, b) joinedWith t(c, d) == t(a, b, c, d)```
 * or using the shorthand:
 * ```t(a, b)..t(c, d) == t(a, b, c, d)```
 *
 * To combine two tuples into one [Tuple2], see [TupleExtending.kt].

// To merge two tuples use t(a, b)..t(c, d) == t(a, b, c, d), you can also add them together using t(a, b) + t(c, d) == t(t(a, b), t(c, d)).
